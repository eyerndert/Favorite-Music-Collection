									<h4>Countries</h4>
									<p>Currently, the chosen countries of Australia, Germany, Russia, Canada, New Zealand, Spain, Dominican Republic, Norway, United Kingdom, Egypt, and America are able to use Pokemon Go. Whats that? We are missing Japan-the birthplace of all that is Pokemon? Well the developers are currently working on improving and expanding the servers as users are attempting to log in en masse and cause many connection issues along with several bugs. The developers want to fix these problems before releasing it to the rest of the world for all to enjoy.</p>
									<h4>Pokestops</h4>
									<p>Pokestops are an esential part of the game as visiting one will give the player extra pokeballs along with one or two additional items. Pokestops can be found in stores, restaurants, colleges, parks, and surprisingly, graveyards. The cities and colleges are brimming with pokestops and gyms in every corner and result in even the restaurants taking advantage of the boom to help there business as well.</p>
